# Store-Checker
A C# console application that uses the Google Places API to check whether a store is currently open, closed, or permanently closed based on real-time Google data.

This C# console application was developed for a large retail distribution company that experienced operational challenges in its logistics and delivery processes. The company supplies products to multiple client outlet stores, some of which may be temporarily closed, operating with limited hours, or permanently closed. Shipping products to these outlets without verifying their operational status resulted in failed deliveries, increased transportation costs, wasted inventory handling, and financial losses.
To address this problem, this script integrates with the Google Places API to programmatically check the operational status of a store before products are dispatched. By retrieving real-time business data from Google, the system determines whether a store is currently open, closed, permanently closed, or unavailable, allowing logistics teams to make informed delivery decisions.
This solution helps the business avoid unnecessary shipments, improve route planning, reduce fuel and labor costs, and increase overall distribution efficiency. The script can be used as a standalone validation tool or integrated into larger warehouse management or logistics systems to ensure that deliveries are only made to active and operational outlet stores.
